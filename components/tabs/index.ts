/**
 * Dashboard Tab Components
 *
 * These components are designed to be used with the main dashboard page.
 * They encapsulate the logic and UI for each tab section.
 *
 * Note: Full migration from page.tsx to these components is in progress.
 * The tab components are functional and can be imported as the refactoring continues.
